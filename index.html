          Hello AMAZE-ing friends! Do you know your way around Montreal?
        </p><p>
          By the end of this session, you'll know your way around some of it.
        </p><p>
          Your (collective) mission: help Rilla source photos representing the locations listed on the next page.
        </p><p>
          Use Google Maps (streetnames and streetview) to work out where Rilla is. She will have an audio connection to you at all times and will post any photos of locations on the map linked from the main page.
          But otherwise, you need to work out where she is and also where to send her next.
        </p><p>
          There is a starting point for you: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/s5MSY55Nuy11VNnC6" target="_blank">Rilla is standing here right now.</a>


        </p><p>
          Are you ready for this? You have 20 minutes, and your time begins <a href="gamePage.html">now</a>.
