          Hello AMAZE-ing friends! Do you know your way around Montreal?
        </p><p>
          By the end of this session, you will (well, some of it).
        </p><p>
          Your (collective) mission: help me source photos representing the locations listed on the next page.
        </p><p>
          Use Google Maps (streetnames and streetview) to work out where I am. I will have an audio connection to you at all times and will post any photos of locations on the map linked from the main page.
          But otherwise, you need to work out where I am and also where to send me next.
        </p><p>
          Here is where I am standing right now: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/rilla-khaled" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/rilla-khaled</a>
        </p><p>
          Are you ready for this? You have 20 minutes, and your time begins <a href="gamePage.html">now</a>.
